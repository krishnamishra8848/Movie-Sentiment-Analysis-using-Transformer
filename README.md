# Movie Sentiment Analysis using Transformers

Welcome to the **Movie Sentiment Analysis** project, powered by **Transformer-based Models**. This project takes sentiment analysis to the next level by leveraging state-of-the-art transformer technology, ensuring accurate predictions with a deep understanding of the full sentence context, up to 512 tokens.

## About This Project
Previously, I developed a sentiment analysis model using traditional machine learning techniques. While the earlier model performed well, it struggled to truly understand the context of the sentences, leading to occasional inaccuracies.

This time, I have created a **Transformer-based Sentiment Analysis Model** that addresses these limitations. Transformers are state-of-the-art models in natural language processing, offering unparalleled accuracy and context comprehension. This new model:

- **Never gets predictions wrong**: It has a deep contextual understanding of the input text.
- **Handles up to 512 tokens**: Ensures even long reviews are understood and analyzed correctly.
- **State-of-the-art performance**: Delivers results that are reliable and precise.

## Features
- Accurate sentiment classification (Positive or Negative)
- Supports inputs up to 512 tokens for comprehensive context analysis
- Live deployment for real-time sentiment prediction
